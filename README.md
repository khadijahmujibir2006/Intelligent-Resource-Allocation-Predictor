   Intelligent Resource Allocation Predictor
 Overview

The Intelligent Resource Allocation Predictor is a machine learning–driven system designed to predict, visualize, and optimize computational resource usage such as CPU, memory, disk, and workload demand in dynamic computing environments.

By learning from historical system metrics, the system forecasts future resource requirements and supports proactive allocation, preventing performance degradation, system overload, and resource wastage.

This project integrates core Computer Science concepts, machine learning, and a Streamlit-based interactive UI, making it both academically strong and industry-relevant.

 Problem Statement

Modern computing environments such as cloud platforms, data centers, and distributed systems face critical challenges:

Over-allocation of resources leading to cost and energy wastage

Under-allocation causing system slowdowns or failures

Static allocation policies that do not adapt to workload changes

Lack of predictive intelligence in traditional resource managers

Most existing systems are reactive, responding after performance issues occur instead of anticipating them.

 Proposed Solution

This project introduces an intelligent, predictive approach to resource management.

Using machine learning and time-series forecasting, the system:

Learns historical resource usage patterns

Predicts future CPU and memory demand

Visualizes trends and comparisons via an interactive UI

Supports data-driven resource allocation decisions

This replaces rigid rule-based policies with adaptive intelligence.
